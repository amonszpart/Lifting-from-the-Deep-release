## Dependencies

The code is compatible with python2.7
- [Tensorflow 1.0](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/)

## Models

The architecture extends the one proposed in [Convolutional Pose Machines (CPM)](https://github.com/shihenw/convolutional-pose-machines-release).

For this demo, CPM's caffe-models trained on the MPI datasets ([link](https://github.com/shihenw/convolutional-pose-machines-release/tree/master/model)) are used for **2D pose estimation**, whereas for **3D pose estimation** our probabilistic 3D pose model is trained on the [Human3.6M dataset](http://vision.imar.ro/human3.6m/description.php).

## Testing
- First, run `setup.sh` to retreive the trained models and to install the external utilities.
- Run `demo.py` to evaluate the test image.

## Additional material

## Notes

The models provided for the demo are NOT the ones that have been used to generate results for the paper. We are still in the process of converting all the code.
